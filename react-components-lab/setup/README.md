## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/labs` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/labs
```

Create a new Vite project for your React app:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

You'll be prompted to choose a project name. Let's name it `react-components-lab`.

- Select a framework. Use the arrow keys to choose the `React` option and hit `Enter`.

- Select a variant. Again, use the arrow keys to choose `JavaScript` and hit `Enter`.

Navigate to your new project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd react-components-lab
npm i
```

Open the project's folder in your code editor:

```bash
code .
```

### Configuring ESLint

Before we begin, we need to adjust the ESLint configuration. Add the indicated rules to the `rules` object in your `eslint.config.js` file:

```javascript
    rules: {
      ...js.configs.recommended.rules,
      ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
      ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
      ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,
      'react/jsx-no-target-blank': 'off',
      'react-refresh/only-export-components': [
        'warn',
        { allowConstantExport: true },
      ],
      'react/prop-types': 'off', // add this line
      'react/no-unescaped-entities': 'off', // add this line
    },
```

The first addition prevents warnings if you don't declare types for your props (which we're not), and the second prevents warnings if you use contractions within JSX.

### Clear `App.jsx`

Open the `App.jsx` file in the `src` directory and replace its contents with the following:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

const App = () => {

  return (
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  );
}

export default App
```

### Running the development server

To start the development server and view our app in the browser, we'll use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see that `Vite` is available on port number 5173:

```plaintext
localhost:5173
```

### GitHub setup

To add this project to GitHub, initialize a Git repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
```

Make a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) named `react-components-lab`.

Link your local project to your remote GitHub repo:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<github-username>/react-components-lab.git
git push origin main
```

> ðŸš¨ Do not copy the above command. It will not work. Your GitHub username will replace `<github-username>` (including the `<` and `>`) in the URL above.
