## About

Welcome to Reactville, a constantly evolving virtual metropolis. Let's build this digital town together, one component at a time.

Reactville Weather Station is at the heart of the town, keeping everyone informed about the ever-changing weather. They're in need of a tech upgrade and have called on you to develop their new 5-Day Weather Forecast App.

In this lab, you will create a user-friendly React application that displays a 5-day weather forecast. You'll implement a dynamic, component-based structure and practice the core concept of passing data using props in React.
