## Version 1.1 - December 25, 2024

### Release details

This release updates lab code to use Vite version 6, and React version 19.

This lab also no longer encourages students to implement React anti-patterns in their code.

#### Additions

None.

#### Changes

- Update lab code to use Vite version 6.
- Update lab code to use React version 19.
- Update to use internal template version 2.
- Adjust instructions so we don't encourage students to implement for `totalStrength` and `totalAgility` as state variables. These can be calculated from the `team` data already held in  state and creating new state variables to hold this data is a React anti-pattern we should avoid.
- Use locally-served assets instead of a third party.
- Clarify exercise requirements.

#### Removals

None.

## Version 1.0 - Updates from legacy content

This release modularizes part of the the legacy React Dev Skills lab.
